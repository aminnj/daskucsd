Getting [dask](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/) up and running at the local T2, based on [this](https://github.com/aminnj/redis-htcondor).

## Quick start

Clone the repository and work inside it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aminnj/daskucsd
cd daskucsd
```

holy... it works finally.
abusing singularity containers + CMSSW + virtualenvs + PYTHONPATH hacking,
but it finally works...locally for now.
